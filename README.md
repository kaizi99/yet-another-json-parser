# YET-ANOTHER-JSON-PARSER

This is a just-for-fun project from me. I just took the Compiler Construction Course in my University and want to apply some of the knowledge I learned there (Lexing, LL(1)-Parsing).

Because JSON is a very easy language (unambigious, lexing wihtout backtracking, simple grammar) to parse, I wanted to start with that.

I also want to make a very fast and memory-efficient parser, without doing ANY dynamic runtime memory allocations (not regarding the dynamically growing process stack ofc.) and with using the least memory possible while still being very fast. But that is only a secondary thing after I get parser working.
